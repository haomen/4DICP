# Hue assisted iterative closest point algorithm for point cloud registraton

## About
My paper [Color Point Cloud Registration with 4D ICP Algorithm](http://menhao.net/research/Publications/IROS2012B.pdf), IEEE ICRA 2011 describes how to combine hue into Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to accelerate point cloud registration. In the past several years, researchers and engineers reached out and requested source code about this algorithm. My previous code was mainly written in C and did not follow a google coding style, so this is the reason I decide to create this repo and re-write the algorithm in C++ to provide a better interface.
